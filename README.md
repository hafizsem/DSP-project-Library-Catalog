# Library Catalog System

## Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive and easily manageable system for librarians to efficiently organize and track the library's daily data. The system provides a user-friendly interface for librarians to perform various tasks related to managing the library catalog.

## Features

### 1. Searching Section

Librarians can easily search for books by entering either the book ISBN or title. This feature enables quick identification of book information, streamlining the process for library visitors.

### 2. Status Checking

After searching for a book, the system displays its status, indicating whether the book is available for borrowing or restricted to remain in the library.

### 3. Adding New Books

Using SQLite as the data retainer, librarians can effortlessly add new books to the database. The system ensures a smooth process for expanding the library collection.

### 4. Borrowing

Librarians can enter relevant data for library members borrowing books, keeping track of who has borrowed what and when.

### 5. Returning

Library members can return borrowed books through the librarian. If a book is not returned by the promised return date, the system automatically calculates a small fine.

### 6. Registering New Users

Librarians can assist new library visitors in becoming members, providing them with the privilege of borrowing library books.

### Additional Enhancements

1. **Insert More Complete Book Info:**
   - The system allows librarians to input additional book information such as the location arranged by genre and author details.

2. **Handling Multiple Copies:**
   - The system accounts for multiple copies of the same book, ensuring accurate inventory management.

3. **Inserting Front Covers:**
   - Librarians can upload and display front covers of books, enhancing the visual experience for users during the search.

4. **Fine Management via Email:**
   - The system automatically sends email notifications to users who have overdue books, including details of fines incurred.
